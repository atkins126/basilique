## Basilique

"Basilique" is the French term for "Basilica", which is a kind of building in Architecture.

> *The Roman basilica was a large public building where business or legal matters could be transacted. **The first basilicas had no religious function at all**. As early as the time of Augustus, a public basilica for transacting business had been part of any settlement that considered itself a city, used in the same way as the covered market houses of late medieval northern Europe, where the meeting room, for lack of urban space, was set above the arcades, however. Although their form was variable, **basilicas often contained interior colonnades that divided the space, giving aisles or arcaded spaces on one or both sides, with an apse at one end (or less often at each end), where the magistrates sat, often on a slightly raised dais**. The central aisle tended to be wide and was higher than the flanking aisles, so that light could penetrate through the clerestory windows.*

So a "Basilique" was just a public gathering place, in the heart of the Roman cities, where people interact and deal with their interests.

## A Text-Centric Social Network

Most Social Networks create their webs around keywords, like `#love` or `#funnykitty`. This new project aims to gather people not only a single word, but whole sentences, chapters, books, or bookshelves of some reference text.

## Open Source Core

Last but not least, this is an Open Source project, released with GPLv3, which core will be used to develop some projects, dedicated to several kind of text material: legal, scientific, religious, litterature.

## Kingdom Driven Design

After using Domain-Driven-Design for years, we defined a cut-down version of DDD, more pragmatic - and lazy. We used these Architecture and Design patterns to develop this project.

During the last EKON 23 technical conferences in Germany, I made some sessions and a workshop about this new project architecture and design.

# Get Started

## Requirements

This project uses *Delphi* or *FPC* for compilation.

The only library requirement is our Open Source https://github.com/synopse/mORMot framework, which can be grabbed from here too.

Stay tuned for more information and code!
