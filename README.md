# Synopse Basilique
Open Source Textual Social Network, following Kingdom Driven Design (KDD)

# A Text-Centric Social Network
Most Social Networks create their webs around keywords, like `#love` or `#funnykitty`. This new project aims to gather people not only a single word, but whole sentences, chapters, books, or bookshelves of some reference text.
Last but not least, this is an Open Source project, released with GPLv3, which core will be used to develop some projects, dedicated to several kind of text material: legal, scientific, religious, litterature.

# Kingdom Driven Design
After using Domain-Driven-Design for years, we defined a cut-down version of DDD, more pragmatic - and lazy. We used these Architecture and Design patterns to develop this project.

Stay tuned for more information and code!
